Learning python for couple weeks now with W3Schools.com and with some
others websites on the internet. After learning the basics of BashScripting, i made a little
two fun CTF games, and a one base64 script with just copy-paste the syntax.
While learning python, i am trying a different types of tests on my machine, just to see
if i understood the point of what the code does. Right now, i made another CTF game, but in python language.
Yes, it took me some time, and now i want to share it with you.
Wanna Play? for these who wants to give it a try, you can, sure you can, but this
little game ment for begginers, ofcourse. You can find it in my Github profile, just clone it and good luck with crack the game.

Have to say that Python is not that easy as people are saying, at least for me, while BashScripting
is more easy for me to get, but i think make practice over and over will make it more
easy with the time, am i right? Well, i hope i am.
You can tell me later what were the username and password if you managed to finish the game LOL!
